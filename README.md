# SWE-Project-2019

Created for a Mississippi State software engineering project


The Project was to make a piece of software to run a restaurant and have individual interfaces for the busboys, cooks, hosts, managers, and waiters.


We used Google's Firebase as a database and Fire# v2 created by ziyasal to connect to Firebase more easily.

This contains all the files except the ApiKey.cs file. The only things contained in it is the FirebasePath and FirebaseSecret used in the Firebase.cs file.
